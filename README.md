## LoL

League of Legends (LoL for short), is a multiplayer online battle arena video game where two teams of five players each battle to destroy the opposite teams base.

This was a project I worked on utilizing various machine learning algorithms to predict the winning team from a dataset containing over 51K matches.

A full analysis on the performance of the algorithms can be found here: https://ericborn.github.io/LoL/ or within the Juypter notebook Lol_predictions.ipynb.
