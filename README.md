## LoL

League of Legends (LoL for short), is a multiplayer online battle arena video game where two teams of five players each battle to destroy the opposite teams base.

This was a project I worked on utilizing various machine learning algorithms to predict the winning team from a dataset containing over 51K matches.

I first cleaned the data, then performed feature selection with five different methods to create various subsets of the data to train and test the models on.

After the setup was completed, I used KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest to perform a total of 51 different predictions on the data.

A full analysis on their performance can be found within the LoL analysis.docx and the code within the Juypter notebook Lol_predictions.ipynb or within the LoL_Predictions.py file.
